# Simple Work Day Scheduler

## Introduction

This is a simple calendar application that allows any user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I have used [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with dates and times.
