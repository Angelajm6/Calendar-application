# Simple Work Day Calendar

## Introduction

This is a simple calendar application that allows any user to save events for each hour of the day. Originally, I built a more complex calendar thinking that was what I was required to do for my assignment, so I stored that code in the file "index_old.html" in case I want to keep working on the calendar in a future. I then recovered the starter code I had in the first place to build this calendar application giving it interactivity and functionality.This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML, CSS and JavaScript powered by jQuery.
I have used [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with dates and times.

## Features

This calendar displays the current date and time at the top of the webpage. There are different timeblocks displayed for standard business hours (9am - 6pm. Yes, never forget we software engineers are hard-workers). At the right of each timeblock there is a blue save button to save each event. 

## How to use

Enter an event in the desired timeblock then click blue save button for that timeblock. The text for that event will be saved in local storage spo that when you refresh the page the events persist.
